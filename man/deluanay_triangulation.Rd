\title{Delaunay triangulation}
\usage{
deluanay_triangulation(points, dim = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{A numeric matrix of points (n x 2 for 2D, n x 3 for 3D).}

\item{dim}{Dimension of the points (2 or 3).}
}
\value{
A matrix of indices representing the triangles (for 2D) or tetrahedra (for
3D) formed by the Delaunay triangulation/tetrahedralization. Each row corresponds to a triangle (3 indices) or tetrahedron (4 indices).
}
\description{
Performs Delaunay triangulation for 2D points and Delaunay tetrahedralization for 3D points using the Bowyer-Watson algorithm.
